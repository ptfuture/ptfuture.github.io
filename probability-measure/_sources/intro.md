Introduction
============================

This is the lecture notes used in the "Probabililty Measure" Video lectures (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLloy3LBMdL1nAunGKA8KY4PdjPjR1ZoaN).

This content is to help people build up the foundation of probability theory. Whether you are a math student or not, you will find this content useful.

Most of my video contents will NOT be elementary math, so as this lecture series. Contents I made will come with rigorous proofs to help you understand the foundation of probability theory.

I encourage you to ask questions and give feedbacks in each video's comment section. This will help me understand what I explained well what I didn't and it will help me improve the quality of teaching in the future.

Moreover, if you find the contents useful, please [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nVqqi4MK495IXNGAg52Mg?view_as=subscriber&sub_confirmation=1) to the channel and share it with those who will also find it useful.
