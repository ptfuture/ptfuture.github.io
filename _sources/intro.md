# Introduction

Can future be predicted, not by superstition, religion or divination but mathematically?

If you believe so just as I do, welcome to my little circle and hang out with me virtually on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nVqqi4MK495IXNGAg52Mg?view_as=subscriber&sub_confirmation=1) and enjoy the moments of joys in the universe of mathematics. 

I'll cover topics in mathematics, programming, simulation, quantitative gambling, quantitative finance and investments.

I encourage you to ask questions and give feedbacks in each video's comment section. This will help me understand what I explained well what I didn't and it will help me improve the quality of teaching in the future.

Moreover, if you find the contents useful, please [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nVqqi4MK495IXNGAg52Mg?view_as=subscriber&sub_confirmation=1) to the channel and share it with those who will also find it useful.
